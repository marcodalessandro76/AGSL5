Electronic and optical properties of the Armchair Graphene SuperLattice with n C atoms between each line of H atom along the Y (armchair) direction

TO DO : 

1) Compute graphene like band structure using rectangular cell, removing the H atoms and setting the z positions of the C atoms to zero.
2) Compute the JDOS at the IP level
